# stm: Structural Topic Model in PySpark

Under active development. The [Structural Topic Model](http://structuraltopicmodel.com/) (STM) allows users to estimate topic models with document-level covariates. This Python library runs in both serial and parallel modes using PySpark. The package includes tools for model selection, visualization, and estimation of topic-covariate regressions.
